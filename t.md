XP_006722621.1:
 - This is a zinc finger protein, a class of proteins that often function as transcription factors to regulate gene expression. While its data does not contain a direct link to a specific disease, its role is regulatory. In the context of this cluster, ZNF397 likely plays a part in controlling the gene expression programs related to the immune and inflammatory processes where the other proteins are involved.
 - No immediate link to the cluster

NP_056445.13:
 - Seemingly directly links to inflammation (The context explicitly notes the role of "EPC2 epigenetic regulation in immune response and inflammation")
 - PC2, an esophageal epithelial cell line, plays a role in epigenetic regulation related to immune responses and inflammation, particularly in the context of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and allergic inflammation

NP_997244.4:
 - Targeted resequencing of the 13q13 spondyloarthritis-linked locus identifies a rare variant in FREM2 possibly associated with familial spondyloarthritis
 - Spondyloarthritis is a chronic, auto-inflammatory disease, linking FREM2 directly to your specified keywords.

NP_001269413.1:
 - I cannot verify the following information: (This protein is explicitly identified as a member of the "GOLGA8R golgin family autoantigens" involved in "signaling in autoimmune disease")
